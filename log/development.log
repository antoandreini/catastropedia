MantÃ©ngase informado, escuche las noticias con atenciÃ³n.\r\nDurante una inundaciÃ³n:\r\n\r\nSi estÃ¡ dentro de su casa: Escuche la radio o televisiÃ³n para estar informado de la emergencia, y posibles instrucciones de la autoridad a cargo.\r\nCorte la luz, agua y gas y evacue su hogar si la situaciÃ³n asÃ­ lo amerita o las autoridades asÃ­ lo indican.\r\nSi estÃ¡ en el exterior: Suba a un lugar alto y permanezca allÃ­.\r\nEvite caminar por aguas en movimiento. Si estÃ¡ en la calle, tenga precauciÃ³n al caminar sobre agua, ya que las tapas de las alcantarillas de agua suelen salirse debido a la presiÃ³n, y usted puede caer en dicho hueco.\r\nSi estÃ¡ en un auto: Si llega a un Ã¡rea inundada, dÃ© la vuelta y tome otra direcciÃ³n. Si el auto se detiene o se atasca, abandÃ³nelo de inmediato y suba a un lugar alto.\r\nDurante una evacuaciÃ³n: Si la situaciÃ³n asÃ­ lo amerita o las autoridades lo indican, evacue su hogar lo antes posible.\r\nDebe estar atento a las indicaciones que se dan por radio y/o televisiÃ³n.\r\nPrepÃ¡rese con tu familia por si es necesario que se vayan a un lugar seguro.\r\nNo se acerque a cables ni postes de luz.\r\nSi necesita cambiar de lugar, solo lleve lo necesario.\r\nNo camine cerca de donde estÃ¡ el agua, pues el nivel puede subir rÃ¡pidamente.\r\nNo intente cruzar cauces de rÃ­os, pues el agua lleva muchas cosas como troncos u objetos que pueden golpearlo fuertemente.\r\nDespÃºes de una inundaciÃ³n:\r\n\r\nSi tuvo que dejar la casa, no regrese a ella hasta que las autoridades indiquen que lo pueden hacer.\r\nSu casa debe ser revisada, ya que es probable que se derrumbe, no entre a ella hasta que estÃ©n seguros de que la pueden usar.\r\nNo se acerque a construcciones que es posible que se derrumben.\r\nNo toque ni pise cables elÃ©ctricos caÃ­dos.\r\nNo tome alimentos ni comida que haya sido mojada por el agua de la inundaciÃ³n.\r\nNo se acerque a la zona inundada ya que su presencia puede entorpecer el trabajo de las personas que auxilian a otros afectados.\r\nLos heridos no se deben mover, es mejor avisar a las personas especializadas para este tipo de ayuda.\r\nEscuche la radio o vea la televisiÃ³n para obtener informaciÃ³n sobre la emergencia, y posibles instrucciones de la autoridad a cargo.\r\nVuelva a su hogar sÃ³lo cuando sea seguro o las autoridades asÃ­ lo indiquen.
